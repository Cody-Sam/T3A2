As a customer who lacks experience in building PC's I would:

- like to be able to have a custom PC built for me so I can have a PC that best suits my needs
- like to be able to be able to design my PC using a interface so that I can visualise what parts are still required
- like to be told what parts are compatible with my current build so that I don't have to spend time researching myself
- like to be able to compare similar items so that I can make the best decisions about what parts to use
- like to be able to save my build so that I can come back later to finish it and/ or purchase it
- like to be able to share my build with others so I can get feedback from them
- like to be able to customise how my PC looks as well as the parts used in it so I can make it personalise to me
- like to be able to purchase my build and have it sent to me so that I can have a custom PC built without me knowing how to do it

As a customer who has experience with building PC's I would:

- like to be able to shop for parts normally so I don't waste time with an app or interface that I don't need
- like to be able to create separate lists of parts for different potential builds so that I can keep track of parts I am interested in
- like to be able to save these builds so I can come back to them later to make changes or to purchase them
- like to be able to share these builds with others so I can get feedback from them
- like to be able to compare parts to each other in the store so that I don't need to open other windows to compare them
- like the option to be able to filter out parts that are not compatible with already selected parts
